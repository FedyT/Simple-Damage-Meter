# **Simple Damage Meter Addon** 📊💥

## **Overview** 🧐

Welcome to the **Simple Damage Meter** project! This ongoing personal learning project explores the exciting world of **World of Warcraft** addon development. The primary goal is not to compete with massive, feature-rich addons, but rather to provide a **simple** and **lightweight solution** for players—especially those with low-end PCs—who need minimal resource usage while still being able to track important data, like damage done in combat. 

## **Purpose** 🎯

The main goal of this addon is to **track and display the total damage** done by players in a group or raid. It’s designed to use **minimal resources** and offer a **clean, intuitive interface**. Right now, the functionality is focused on showing **damage data**, but future updates will include more advanced features, such as **UI customization** and detailed **damage statistics**.

## **Why Lightweight?** ⚙️

This addon is built with **low-end PC players** in mind. It uses **minimal system resources**, so even players with older hardware can benefit from this tool without worrying about performance issues. The focus is on **simplicity**, **intuitiveness**, and **optimized resource consumption**.
