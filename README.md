**Simple Damage Meter Addon**

**Overview**

Welcome to the Simple Damage Meter project! This is an ongoing personal learning project as I explore the world of World of Warcraft addon development. The core goal is not to compete with massive, feature-rich addons but to provide a simple, lightweight solution for players, particularly those with low-end PCs, who need minimal resource usage while still tracking key data like damage done in combat.

**Whatâ€™s the Purpose?**
The main goal of this addon is to track and display the total damage done by players in a group or raid. It's designed to use minimal resources and provide a simple, clean interface. The functionality is currently focused on showing the damage data, and I plan to improve it further with more features such as UI customization and advanced damage statistics in future updates.

**Why Lightweight?**
This addon is created with low-end PC players in mind. It uses minimal resources, so even players running the game on older hardware can benefit from this tool without worrying about performance hits. The idea is to keep things simple, intuitive, and optimized for lower resource consumption.

**Future Plans**

In future updates, I plan to:
Learn and implement better UI design: Currently, the focus is on functionality, but I will gradually introduce better UI implementation.

Add more features: Tracking other combat metrics, advanced customization options, and a more detailed damage breakdown are on the horizon.

**Acknowledgements**
This is my first step in addon development, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving. Your feedback and suggestions are always appreciated!

Stay tuned for future improvements!
