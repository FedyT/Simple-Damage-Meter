SimpleDamageMeter Addon
This is a simple World of Warcraft addon I created to track the damage done by players in the game. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. It also formats large damage numbers (K/M) for easier reading.

Features:
Tracks overall damage done in the current fight.

Displays damage in a movable, resizable window on the screen.

Formats large numbers into more readable values (e.g., 1,000 becomes 1K, 1,000,000 becomes 1M).

Shows a list of players in the group and their individual damage (coming soon).

Version: 1.0.0
Initial release.

About:
This project is part of my learning journey in coding World of Warcraft addons for fun and personal growth. I'm exploring how to interact with the WoW API, manage user interface elements, and learn the Lua programming language along the way.

Feel free to fork and contribute if you want to help improve the addon!
